                '\nIt is currently estimated that 23.5 million people in the US live in areas that qualify as food deserts. Nearly half of these people are also low-income.'
                '\nThe amount of food deserts in the United States may also be under-reported because small corner grocery stores are placed in the same category as large supermarkets.'
                '\nHowever, these corner stores often do not sell fresh or healthy food such as fruits and vegetables. Due to a lack of transportation or financial means, people who live in food deserts may rely more heavily on fast food.'
                '\nThis can lead to an increase in health problems in food desert regions, such as an increase in diabetes and obesity.'
